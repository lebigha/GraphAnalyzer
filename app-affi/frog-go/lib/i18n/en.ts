        title: "Frequently Asked Questions",
        subtitle: "Everything you need to know about trading with Frog AI.",
        q1: "Is this a scam like Telegram signals?",
        a1: "No. Frog AI doesn't sell signals. You upload YOUR chart, you get YOUR analysis. No private group, no mysterious \"calls\". Just an AI that reads price like a pro and gives you key levels. You stay in full control.",
        q2: "What if the AI is wrong?",
        a2: "No tool is 100% perfect. Frog AI shows 89% accuracy in identifying trends and key levels (tested on 12,000+ charts). Use it as a second opinion to validate your analysis, not as a crystal ball.",
        q3: "Is it really free?",
        a3: "Yes! 3 free analyses per day, no credit card required, no sign-up. We believe in value first. If you want unlimited scans, a Pro version will be available soon.",
        q4: "Does it work on Crypto, Forex AND Stocks?",
        a4: "Absolutely. The AI analyzes price structure: support, resistance, trends. These concepts are universal. Bitcoin on 15min, EUR/USD on H4, or Tesla on Daily — same logic, same precision.",
        q5: "Are my charts private?",
        a5: "100%. Your images are processed ephemerally by our secure AI engine. No data is stored, sold, or shared. You stay anonymous.",
